  Developer Note:
  
    This story is all about a guy named Jaiden who goes through so much adventure about his flight into madness as he crashes
    into a jungle and has to make a decision that will change the course of the adventure. Although this project was written in a joke format it was a cool project to work on
    
      Notices:
        (Mentions of "he" is referring to the main character Jaiden)
        (The ending is a complicated version of saying you reached the true ending of the story)
        (The Gorilla was not Harambe)
        (Teases of a part 2 are not confirmed)
